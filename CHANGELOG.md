## [3.2.0] - 2023-04-20

### Updated
* We fully updated a set of sample apps. They are now available for all the test cases. In particular, you can find sample apps for the iOS and macOS platforms; Swift and Objective-C languages; UIKit, AppKit, Mac Catalyst, and SwiftUI interfaces; SPM, CocoaPods, or manual integrations.
* We updated icons for sample apps so that they have dark backgrounds now.

### Fixed
* [iOS] When a user activated an iOS app, the notification on activation sometimes did not fit the screen size. We worked on layout issues and fixed them.
* [iOS] Previously we didn‚Äôt handle the blocked subscription case for iOS apps, so we couldn‚Äôt explain to users precisely why they could not activate via Setapp. Now we handle this case, and the users know they have blocked subscriptions.
* [iOS] Users with Setapp subscriptions were signed in via Setapp even after app reinstallation. We fixed this, and now they must re-activate the app.
* The Electron sample app on Apple Silicon Macs now works smoothly.
* There was an error in the Setapp Framework integration via CocoaPods, and it‚Äôs now fixed.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking
This release contains some breaking API changes. See the New and Changed sections below for details. 

### New
* Added completion handlers to the `open` methods. Now, you can get a callback when the Setapp subscription state is resolved.
* Added new `viewController(for:)` method that returns a simple view controller with the result of resolving a Setapp subscription state.

### Changed
* Logs: moved log level and handles from the instance to the class level.


## [0.0.4] - 2020-11-06

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking
* CocoaPods: To support the use of the Simulator on Macs with Apple Silicon, we‚Äôve changed the source binary format from the universal binary (fat) framework to XCFramework. To work with the latest Framework format, you need CocoaPods version 1.9 or later and Xcode version 11.0 or later.

### New
* Apple Silicon support.

### Changed
* Removed default parameter values in the `SetappConfiguration.init` method.
* Logs: added metadata output on error.


## [0.0.3] - 2020-07-22

### New
* The `SetappManager` class now has the explicit `start` method.
‚Äã
### Fixed
* In rare cases, the iOS app wasn‚Äôt activated for Setapp members even if the Framework configuration was correct and the testing went fine. The problem was related with the Framework handling responses from the Setapp system under specific circumstances. Now, in the same situations, the Framework is more stable and the app gets activated.

### Deprecated
* The `SetappManager.configuration` property setter has been deprecated. Use the new `start` method instead.
